# minecolonies-styles

MineColony styles I use.  Almost all of them are modified versions of standard styles.  I chose structures that I like, and then made whatever modifications were needed to make them adhere to a midieval style.  This means that the stuctures are not all from a single standard style;  Town hall is from medieval oak, but tavern is from somewhere else, but modified to be more medieval style.

I made these because I strongly prefer consistancy.

- Replaced all mossy, cracked, etc. with their standard block.
- Replaced all stone/cobblestone that was for walls and supports with stone bricks.
- Kept shingles to single style.  No mixing red brick shingles and brick shingles, etc.
- In some cases, converted non-shingle roofs to shingled roofs.
- Replaced verious shingles to brick shingles.
- Removed buttons from end of logs (I really don't understand this one).
- Etc.

To use the style, place the named folder into your blueprints folder.  For ATM8, this is like this:

{root of minecraft instance folder}/blueprints/oakstonebrick/...

For windows using the FTB launcher for ATM8, for me, this is:

c:\Users\Russell\AppData\Local\\.ftba\instances\e4c596e4-baea-4e81-a136-61bfbaf509cf\blueprints\oakstonebrick

which is:

{windows drive}:\Users\\{username}\AppData\Local\\.ftba\instances\\{instance UUID}\blueprints\oakstonebrick

It appears in my styles selection when using the builders wand.
